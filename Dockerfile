# Copy dependency installation from the 'base' stage (if you had a more complex build)
# In this simple case, we already installed in 'base' and are using 'base' as 'final' effectively.
# If 'base' had build tools you don't need in final, you'd copy like this:
# COPY --from=base /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages
# COPY --from=base /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

# Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# Expose any port your application might run on (e.g., for a web server)
# EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run when the container starts.
# Replace `your_main_script.py` with your actual application entry point.
# If you don't have a single entry point, you might want to default to bash:
# CMD ["bash"]
# Or if you have a main script:
CMD ["python3", "detect_pretrained.py"]
